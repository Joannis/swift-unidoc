# Getting started

This article demonstrates how to link to documentation in other modules.

## Codelinks

You can link to a module with a codelink: ``BarbieCore``.

You can link to a declaration with a codelink: ``Barbie.ID``.

You can link to modules from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module: ``_Concurrency``.

You can link to declarations from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module: ``Task``.

## Doclinks

You can link to a module with a doclink: <doc:BarbieCore>.

You can link to a declaration with a doclink: <doc:Barbie.ID>.

You can link to modules from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module: <doc:_Concurrency>.

You can link to declarations from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module: <doc:Task>.

## Relative hyperlinks

You can link to a module with a relative hyperlink. For example, `[``BarbieCore``](./BarbieCore)`
produces [``BarbieCore``](./BarbieCore).

You can link to a declaration with a relative hyperlink. For example,
`[``Barbie.ID``](./Barbie/ID)` produces [``Barbie.ID``](./Barbie/ID).

You can link to modules from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module. For example, `[``_Concurrency``](./_Concurrency)` produces
[``_Concurrency``](./_Concurrency).

You can link to declarations from other packages/frameworks that are dependencies of the current
module. For example, `[``Task``](./Task)` produces [``Task``](./Task).
